- These are the general steps a student **should** follow before submitting for review:
 - Run the project. Go through the app and confirm that there are no crashes or [ANRs](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/anr.html).
 2. Check the project rubric and confirm that your app meets the requirements. (This step is optionsal, but it will save you for a lots of re-submissions)
 3. If you are using Git, be sure to include a `.gitignore` file, else clean your project.
